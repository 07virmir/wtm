## Inspiration
The inspiration behind this is sourced from our various teammates having recently subpar experiences at parties/friday night plans, be it when people don't end up at the same party due to lack of communication, or lack of planning.

## What it does
Our app provides an easy to use interface to plan and view parties on a map, with full CRUD. We also aim to make it a trendy experience with our UI.

## How we built it
We built it using React Native and Google Cloud (Firebase), along with some Expo libraries.

## Challenges we ran into
None of team really had that much mobile dev experience, which made it hard to build the app, especially when it came to setting things up. But we were able to google our way through the framework and it ended up working.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Just learning how to use React Native as well as Firebase from scratch in the span of 48 hours was something we found really impressive. Also, the UI design decisions we made was also something that we take a lot of pride in.

## What we learned
Just a lot about the structure of a mobile app.

## What's next for WtmApp
Expanding on existing features and trying to turn it into a social media type experience like recent apps (bereal, lapse) is probably our goal.
